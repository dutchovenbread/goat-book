What I need to do to configure Route 53 to use the hosted zone for the subdomain:
1. get the name servers for the hosted zone for the subdomain (above)
2. Choose the name of the hosted zone for the domain (in the other account)
3. Choose "create record."
4. Choose simple routing and choose "next"
5. Choose "Define Simple Record"
6. Specify the following values
Name: name of the subdomain (above)
Record type: choose "NS-Name servers for a hosted zone"
TTL:172800 seconds
7. Choose "define simple record" and choose "create records"
8. Delete any hosted zone records from the domain.

Public IP address of the server: 18.220.5.134
Private IP address of the server: 10.0.1.148

What I need to do to configure Route 53 to route traffic to the server

1. Get the IP address (above)
2. In Route53, choose hosted zones
3. Choose "create record"
4. Specify routing policy, name, value/route traffic to, record type, ttl
5. Choose "create records"

That seems pretty simple. See if I can do that in CloudFormation.

Successful in the console, but failed with error message "no hosted zone named ..." in CloudFormation

Changed server to allow port 22.
Changing image of server to Ubuntu 24.04
